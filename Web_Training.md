Web Training Hierarchy
===

It is generally really challenging to identify developers who are rockstar super-achievers in the web platform.  Part of the problem is that there is no clear or identifiable metric of success.  Unfortunately, a deeper cause of the problem is that there is no structured guidance as to which skills are important or how to progress technically.  An individual must simply figure it out on their own, which is troubling considering the web platform is constantly growing and contains so many various technologies and requirements.

To provide some order in chaos this guide seeks to outline training guidance as a series of progressive levels.  It is inspired by the organization of educational and task standards taught in the US Army.  The guide will start with Level 1, which is the foundation.  This is not to say that a Level 1 skill or more less important than a Level 4 skill, but instead seeks only to provide a sense of direction.  It is necessary for a wise old sage at the highest levels to occasionally refresh their Level 1 skills.
